Setup
-----
You can obtain the LeapMotion SDK for your platform at: https://developer.leapmotion.com/

The Leap Motion libraries needed to run this code should be in this repo so you do not need
to download the leap sdk.

You will need to install the leapmotion drivers available on leapmotion.com and you will need to install
PureData environment in order to run the PureData source backend.
